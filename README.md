# Resources

### Nix & NixOS Sources

Official:
- [NixOS website](https://nixos.org/)
- [Nix package manager & NixOS download](https://nixos.org/download/)
  - The Nix package manager has many choices, especially on the unstable channel.
  - However, I'd advise against it if you really want to get into Nix's declarative nature. Unless you just want a good package manager, then go ahead.
- [Nix ecosystem documentation](https://nix.dev)
  - [Nix language guide](https://nix.dev/tutorials/nix-language)
- [Search Nix packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages)
- [Search NixOS options](https://search.nixos.org/options)

Unofficial:

- [Awesome Nix](https://github.com/nix-community/awesome-nix)
- [NixOS & Flakes Book](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world)
  - [Very helpful guide to Nix flakes](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixos-with-flakes/introduction-to-flakes)
    - Nix flakes may seem daunting at first, but they make it super easy to add extra sources and configuration options. Plus, they're declarative while nix channels are not.
- [Nix User Repository](https://nur.nix-community.org/)
- [User-maintained NixOS wiki](https://nixos.wiki)
  - [Nix applications and ecosystem](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Applications)
- [Remember to optimize your NixOS storage](https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/1cunvdw/friendly_reminder_optimizestore_is_not_on_by/)

### Home Manager
A declarative approach to configuring your user environment! It's very much like NixOS's configuration file, but just for the home directory. It's great if you want to tinker without adding a bunch of generations to your boot menu, or use different configurations for users on the same system.

It can work on other distros tooâ€”I tried it on openSUSE Tumbleweed, though not long-term.

- [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
- [Home Manager manual](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/)
- [Home Manager configuration options manual](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml)
- [Search Home Manager options](https://home-manager-options.extranix.com/)

### Extras
The NixOS configuration file and Home Manager are what I mainly use, but here are some other interesting tools.

- [nh](https://github.com/viperML/nh), a pretty wrapper & helper for Nix and Home Manager
- [NixVim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim), for configuring Neovim and its plugins declaratively
  - [NixVim documentation](https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/)
- [Stylix](https://github.com/danth/stylix), for quick universal colorschemes and fonts
  - [Stylix documentation](https://danth.github.io/stylix/options/nixos.html)
- [Nix-colors](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfwm4/start), for managing color palettes
- [Nix-rice](https://github.com/bertof/nix-rice/), for managing color palettes
- [Plasma-manager](https://github.com/pjones/plasma-manager), for configuring KDE Plasma declaratively
- [System Manager](https://github.com/numtide/system-manager), for managing system configuration with Nix

# Pieces of Advice

- Use `nix path-info nixpkgs#<package-name>` if at all possible
  - Trust me, it is *not* fun to manually search through nix/store/ to find the path to a specific package file.
  - The sooner you're aware of this, the better!
- If you choose to start with a starter config, start small!
  - You can understand a lot by configuring things yourself, and configs that are too complex may confuse you out of touching them.
  - If you really want a config without the manual effort, NixOS is probably not for you.
- It's absolutely true that NixOS documentation is sparse.
  - If you really want to dig deep, don't be afraid to look through the source code or the manuals.
  - You can do a ton on NixOS, but it takes time, effort, and undoubtly frustration.
- You don't need to rely on the options NixOS and Home Manager give you to create config files
  - NixOS has `environment.etc."path/file.type"`, meaning etc/path/file.type
  - Home Manager has `home.file."path/file.type"`, meaning home/user/path/file.type, and `xdg.configFile."path/file.type"`, meaning ~/.config/path/file.type!
  - Optionally, you can use `"path/file.type".source = config.lib.file.mkOutOfStoreSymlink /absolute/path/to/source/file` to symlink an existing file to the location you want
  - Or create your own modules.
- NixOS works very differently to other Linux distros, but that's why I enjoy it!
