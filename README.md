### Extra Cool Stuff

These are things I used that ended up not entirely fitting my use-case, but they're wonderful nonetheless and I totally respect and recommend them!

# Resources

### Nix & NixOS Sources

Official:

- [NixOS website][n1]
- [Nix package manager & NixOS download][n2]
  - The `nix-env` package manager works like most other package managers.
  - However, I'd advise against it if you really want to get into Nix's declarative nature
    - Unless all you want is just a good package manager
- [Nix ecosystem documentation][n3]
  - [Nix language guide][n4]
- [NixOS wiki][n5]
- Search
  - [Search Nix packages][n6]
  - [Search NixOS options][n7]

Unofficial:

- [Awesome Nix][n8]
- Flakes
  - [NixOS & Flakes Book][n9]
  - [Very helpful guide to Nix flakes][n10]
  - Nix flakes may seem daunting at first, but they make it super easy to add extra sources and configuration options. Plus, they're declarative while nix channels are not.
- [Nix User Repository (NUR)][n11]
- [User-maintained NixOS wiki][n12]
  - [Nix applications and ecosystem][n13]
- [Remember to optimize your NixOS storage][n14]

### Home Manager

A declarative approach to configuring your user environment! It's like NixOS's configuration file, but only for the home directory. It's great if you want to tinker without adding a bunch of generations to your boot menu, or use different configurations for users on the same system.

It can work on other distros tooâ€”I tried it on openSUSE Tumbleweed, though not long-term.

### Extras

I mainly use NixOS and Home Manager, but here are some other interesting tools.

- [nh][em1], a pretty wrapper for rebuilding
- [NixVim][em2], for configuring Neovim and its plugins declaratively
  - [Documentation][em3]
- [Stylix][em5], for quick universal colorschemes and fonts
  - [Documentation][em6]
- [nix-flatpak][em4], for managing Flatpaks declaratively

# Pieces of Advice

- Use `nix path-info nixpkgs#<package-name>`!
  - Trust me, it is _not_ fun to manually search through `nix/store/` to find a specific package file
  - The sooner you're know this, the better!
- If you want a starter config, start small!
  - You can understand a lot by doing things yourself
  - And configs that are too complex may confuse you out of changing them
  - If you really want a config without the manual effort, NixOS is probably not for you
- NixOS documentation is truly sparse
  - To dig deep, don't be afraid to look through the source code and manuals
  - You can do a ton on NixOS, but it takes time, effort, and undoubtly frustration
- You don't need to rely on the options NixOS and Home Manager give you to create config files
  - NixOS has `environment.etc."path/file.type"`, meaning `etc/path/file.type`
  - Home Manager has many:
    - `home.file."path/file.type"` means `home/user/path/file.type`
    - `xdg.configFile."path/file.type"` means `~/.config/path/file.type`
      - (Unless you changed your XDG config directory)
  - You can use `"path/file.type".source = config.lib.file.mkOutOfStoreSymlink /absolute/path/to/file` to symlink an existing file to the location you want
  - Or create your own modules
- NixOS works very differently to other Linux distros, but that's why I enjoy it!
